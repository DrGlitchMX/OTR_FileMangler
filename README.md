# OTR_FileMangler
A tool for moving the material you loaded from OnlineTVRecorder.com to the appropriate place.

**onlinetvrecorder.com** is a great service, bringing TV content into the 21st century - no 'airtime', no advertisements:
just download what you want to see (and what has already been aired), and watch whenever you like.

One tiny downside remains, nevertheless: most of the time, people will need to select their shows, click
download, and wait for it to finally arrive. And: they need to sort files themselves. The original naming
of the OTR files is also usually not what most people will want (it contains to much meta information
and is not suitable for sorting, for example).

This tiny script wants to help the effort. Its purpose is to copy files from an **incoming** folder to
either the correct subfolder in a "series" folder, or to a more generic "movies" folder.
